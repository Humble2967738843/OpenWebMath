## Repository for text extraction

First, download the `data/filtered_gt_math_added_ds.jsonl` file from Slack and extract it into the `../data` folder.

Then, you can run the following command to run our extraction code:

```python text_extract/extract.py --input data/filtered_gt_math_added_ds.jsonl --output extracted```
